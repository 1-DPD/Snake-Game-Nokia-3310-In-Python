**Snake 3310 (Python Remake)**

Snake 3310 is a faithful recreation of the classic Nokia 3310 Snake game, using the Python programming language. The game features simple yet addictive gameplay, where you control a snake that must collect food while avoiding hitting itself or the walls of the arena.

To play, simply use the arrow keys to move the snake in the desired direction. The snake will continue moving in that direction until you change it again. If the snake hits itself or the walls of the arena, the game is over.

As you collect food, the snake will grow longer. This makes it more difficult to avoid hitting itself, but it also means that you can score more points. The game ends when you hit yourself or the walls of the arena.

Snake 3310 is a great way to relive your childhood memories or to simply enjoy a classic arcade game. It is also a great way to learn the basics of Python programming.
